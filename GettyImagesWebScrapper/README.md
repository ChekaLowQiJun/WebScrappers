In this project, I created a Web Scrapper to scrap images off the website Getty Images without their watermarks.
To develop my skills as a developer, I decided to implement error-handling capabilities into the script as well.
As such, invalid inputs will be rejected by the program.
Please refer to the Requirements.txt file to know which libraries need to be installed locally for the script to run.
DISCLAIMER: Please do not bombard their server with too many requests as that might lead to your IP address being banned
P.S. If there are any bugs or possible improvements to my script, please feel free to notify me :)
